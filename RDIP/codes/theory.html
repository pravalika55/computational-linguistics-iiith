<p><u>Clause</u>
A clause typically contains a subject noun phrase and a finite verb. Some languages allow subjects to be omitted. There are two types of subclauses:
<ol><li>independent clause</li>
<li>subordinate clause</li></ol></p>

<p>Independent clause shows the complete meaning in it. For example: Ram eats. A subordinate clause is not a complete sentence. For example: because I am sick. Sentences can also be classified on the basis of clauses.</p>

<p>Classification on the basis of clauses are:
<ol>
<li>A simple sentence consists of only one independent clause. There are no subordinate clauses.</li>
<li>A compound sentence consists of more than one independent clauses joined ny conjunctions or punctuations. There are no subordinate clauses.</li>
<li>A complex sentence consists of atleast one indpendent clause and a single subordinate clause</li>
<li>A complex-compoundssentence consists of more than one independent clauses and atleast one of the independent clauses has one or more than one subordinate clauses</li></ol></p>
